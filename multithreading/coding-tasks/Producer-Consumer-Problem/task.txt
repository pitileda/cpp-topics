Task 1: Producer-Consumer Problem
Objective: Implement a producer-consumer problem using multiple threads.

1. Create a shared buffer (e.g., a queue) between producer and consumer threads.
2. Use mutexes and condition variables to synchronize access to the buffer.
3. The producer should add data to the buffer if it's not full, 
   and the consumer should remove data from the buffer if it's not empty.
4. Allow multiple producers and multiple consumers, 
   and observe how the program performs with different numbers of threads.

Key Concepts: Mutex, Condition Variables, Synchronization
